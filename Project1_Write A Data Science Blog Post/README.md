## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute: </br>
` pip install -r requirements.txt `

You will need to download Seattle Airbnb Open Data. You can find the data to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). </br>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We used Airbnb data to analyze accommodation costs in Seattle:

1. How do listing prices vary across different types of accommodations in Seattle?
2. What are the seasonal variations in accommodation prices in Seattle? When are the prices at their lowest and highest?
3. Which features of accommodations (such as beds, cleaning_fee, accommondates) have the most significant impact on the pricing?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- `Seattle Airbnb Data.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and addressing the above questions.
